# re-space2d
A tiny self-challenge to show off my growth as a Unity developer.



# Challenge design
Finish in a week

2 days on the weekend: mostly programming

2-3 evenings of work days: mostly polish



# Game design


## General direction
An arcade twin-stick shooter


## Design't
Features that are too fat to do in 2-3 hours (code &| content)

* Multiple scenes
* Saved PC progression
* Multiple bosses


## Designest
Features that are dirt cheap to implement (in either code | content)
* SFX
* BGM
* Screen effects (on events like PC health, NPC destruction etc)
* VFX using sprites
* Trails
* Background (parallax-ed bgs are cheap too)
* Physics collisions (these don't really fit into the gameplay part. Mb I can use them for debris?)
* Lighting

PS:
* Bullet color (depending on damage)


## Design
This is data design intertwined with flow design. This way was the easiest for me to put on paper.
* Bg (the easist way is to make it a global system)
	* The bg can change depending on conditions like: boss present, pc low health, etc
* Splash / start screen
	* Leaderboards (for the arcade feel)
	* Made by: me
	* Press X to start
* On start
	* GUI
	* A controllable pc
		* WASD to move
		* Arrows to shoot
	* Stages (aka levels, setting up SOs with linked enemies is a cheap way to create content)
* GUI
	* Health
	* Stage
	* Score
	* Â¿Upgrades?
* A stage
	* Settings
		* Enemies to spawn during the stage (type + count)
		* Upgrades to spawn (key + value)
		* That's it
	* Spawns enemies
		* Different algos for enemy spawning might be a cheap way to add some diversity. But they also may be totally ignored by the Player
	* Spawns upgrades
		* Preferrably near the middle of the stage.
	* Waits for the enemies and upgrades to die
	* Next stage
* An enemy - I see it as a rather functional entity
	* Moves in a pattern (movement pattern SO)
	* Shoots in a pattern (attack pattern SO)
	* Has health
	* Dies
		* From bullets (adds score)
		* Goes off-screen
* A boss : enemy
	* Stages - the only addition to the enemy
		* Quick thought - an enemy can be just a 1 stage boss
	* Doesn't die off-screen
* An upgrade
	* Moves in a pattern (no need to overcomplicate upgrades, a line will be enough)
	* Dies
		* Gets eaten by the PC (adds score)
		* Goes off-screen
	* Upgrades
		* Health
		* Move speed
		* Bullet damage
		* Attack pattern
* The Player's death
	* Show the score (and the placement on the LB)
		* Choose a name
	* Press A to restart, press B to go to the start

PS:
* A combo system

## Data design
Since the project isn't huge, I might as well quickly map this out

	* Total HP
	* Stage info
* Boss enemy SO
	* Total HP
	* Stages

	* Upgrade SO
* Level stage SO
	* Spawn pattern SO
	* Enemies
